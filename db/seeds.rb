# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# UserBuilding.create(user_id: 11, building_id: 3)
#
# UserBuilding.create(user_id: 11, building_id: 2)
#
# Topic.create(building_id: 2, title: "Building Construction", description: "Materials and such")
# Topic.create(building_id: 2, title: "Laundry Room Updates", description: "Laundry room etiquette dialogue")
#
# Message.create(user_id: 9, topic_id: 2, content: "Please stop dripping detergent on the machines!")
# Message.create(user_id: 5, topic_id: 2, content: "Who left their socks in the dryer? Come to 5B to pick them up. They are brown.")
# Message.create(user_id: 8, topic_id: 1, content: "What's that loud noise coming from the basement?")
